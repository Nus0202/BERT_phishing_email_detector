This is Zhengxiao Sun's final Project.

All mandatory files are included in this zip file.

Because of the size of 'model.safetensors' exceeds 1Gb, and the limitation of submission on Courselink is 1 Gb. So, I could not compress my model to a zip file and submit it. I uploaded it to a Google Drive and make it public so you can access and download it on your own computer.

Download it and put it under the path of other files.

If you want to run the Steramlit front-end on your own. First, please make sure install all the packages in requirements.txt.

Then, type 'streamline run app.py' on your own develop environment, such as Visual Studio Code.

Please let me know if you can not run the code.
